To gain new customers, a given company must explore different marketing outlets - social media, email, etc - to increase the number of customers and revenue. 
The data in question belongs to a fictional marketing firm - Momentum Marketing. With the provided dataset, we evaluate each type of campaign and its 
key performance indicators (KPIs) to present findings between each campaign. 

Taking this marketing data one step further, different machine learning models are evaluated to help the company better predict 
if based on the campaign interactions a customer will complete a purchase.
